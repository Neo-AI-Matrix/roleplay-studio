## Part 1: Guru Strategies Applied

### Alex Hormozi Framework ($100M Leads)

Hormozi's approach for early-stage customer acquisition:

#### 1. **Lead Magnet Strategy**
Create a "free value bomb" that's so good people feel obligated to buy:

- **"The Sales Objection Handling Cheat Sheet"** - PDF with the 15 most common objections + AI-tested responses
- **"5-Minute Cold Call Warm-Up Script Generator"** - Free web tool that generates practice scenarios
- **"Before/After Sales Call Analysis"** - Free analysis of one recorded call using AI

> *Hormozi principle: "The best way to get customers is to give them so much value upfront they feel guilty not buying."*

#### 2. **The "Core 4" Acquisition Methods**
Hormozi identifies 4 core ways to get customers. For early stage, prioritize 1 and 2:

| Method | Hormozi's Take | Roleplay Studio Application |
|--------|----------------|----------------------------|
| **1. Warm Outreach** | Start with people who already know you | Founder's LinkedIn network, past colleagues, industry contacts |
| **2. Cold Outreach** | Reach strangers directly | LinkedIn DMs to Sales Managers, SDR Leaders, Enablement Directors |
| **3. Content** | Attract inbound via education | LinkedIn posts showing AI roleplay demos |
| **4. Paid Ads** | Skip until you have product-market fit | Save for later |

#### 3. **Free Work as a Wedge**
Hormozi advocates doing free work to get testimonials:

> "Do it for free for 10 people. Get insane results. Then charge."

**Tactical application:**
- Offer 5-10 sales teams free 30-day access in exchange for:
  - Video testimonial if they like it
  - Case study with metrics (calls improved, confidence scores, etc.)
  - LinkedIn post about their experience

## Part 2: Competitive Analysis

### Direct Competitors

| Competitor | Positioning | Target | Pricing | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|------------|-------------|--------|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Second Nature** | Enterprise AI roleplay | Large sales orgs | Custom (est. $15-50/seat/mo) | Oracle, GoHealth as customers; established brand | Enterprise-focused, likely expensive for SMBs |
| **Hyperbound** | Cold calling practice AI | SDRs, BDRs | Est. $50-100/seat/mo | Influencer backing (Josh Braun, Morgan Ingram); highly realistic | Cold calling focused mainly |
| **Quantified** | Life sciences sales training | Pharma, medtech | Enterprise custom | Deep in regulated industries | Very vertical-specific |
| **Yoodli** | General communication coaching | Enterprises, L&D | Custom | Google partnership; broader than just sales | Less sales-specific |
| **PitchMonster** | Sales pitch practice | Sales teams | Unknown | Customizable ICP matching | Less established |
| **Brevity** | Conversation training + scoring | Sales teams | Unknown | Automated scoring | Less brand recognition |

### Competitive Gap Analysis

**Opportunity: The "Indie" Tier**
Most competitors target enterprise. Roleplay Studio can own the:
- Individual contributor market ($29/mo)
- Small sales team market ($99/mo for team features)
- Bootstrapped startup market
- Freelance sales trainers needing tools

### How Competitors Acquire Customers

1. **Hyperbound:** Heavy influencer partnerships, founder-led LinkedIn content, free demo calls
2. **Second Nature:** Enterprise sales team, case studies, Salesforce AppExchange listing
3. **Quantified:** Trade shows (LTEN), industry-specific marketing
4. **Yoodli:** Google partnership, PR, content marketing

**Key Insight:** Hyperbound's success came from getting sales influencers to use and post about the product organically. Replicate this.

## Part 3: Channel Strategy

### Primary Channels (80% of effort)

#### 1. **LinkedIn (Direct Outreach + Content)**

**Why:** This is where every Sales Manager, SDR Leader, and Enablement Director lives.

**Outreach Targets:**
- Sales Managers at 10-100 person companies
- SDR/BDR team leads
- Sales Enablement Managers
- VP of Sales at startups
- Customer Success Managers (for support training angle)

**Daily Activity:**
- 20 connection requests with personalized notes
- 10 follow-up DMs to accepted connections
- 2-3 comments on influencer posts
- 1 original post per day

**Content Themes:**
- "Watch our AI handle the 'send me an email' objection" (screen recording)
- "I trained on 50 cold calls this week without burning a single lead"
- Objection handling tips (with CTA to practice them)
- Before/after confidence scores from users
- Comparison: "Traditional roleplay vs. AI roleplay"

**Outreach Script Template:**
```
Hi [Name],

Noticed you're leading the [SDR/Sales] team at [Company]. 

Quick question: how do your reps currently practice handling tough objections before live calls?

Built something specifically for this - no pitch, just curious if it solves a real pain for you.

[Name]
```

#### 2. **Community Infiltration**

**Target Communities:**
1. Sales Enablement Collective (Slack) - PRIORITY
2. RevGenius (Slack)
3. r/sales (Reddit)
4. Modern Sales Pros (LinkedIn)

**Rules:**
- NO product pitching for first 30 days
- Answer questions, add value
- When someone asks "how do you practice cold calls?" → mention the solution naturally
- Build reputation before promoting

#### 3. **Founder-Led Sales (Warm Network)**

**Step 1:** List everyone in your network who:
- Manages a sales team
- Works in sales enablement
- Knows someone who does

**Step 2:** Personal outreach:
```
Hey [Name],

Working on something new - AI that lets sales reps practice conversations 
without burning real prospects. Think flight simulator for sales calls.

Would love your honest take. Got 15 min for a quick demo? 
Happy to give you lifetime free access in exchange for feedback.
```

**Target:** 50 warm outreach messages → 15 demos → 5 early customers

### Secondary Channels (20% of effort)

#### 4. **Strategic Partnerships**

**Partner Types:**
| Partner Type | Value Exchange |
|--------------|----------------|
| Sales trainers/coaches | They get a tool for clients, you get referrals |
| Sales bootcamps | Integration into curriculum |
| CRM companies | Marketplace listing (HubSpot, Salesforce AppExchange) |
| Sales podcasters | Free tool in exchange for mentions |

**First 3 Partnership Targets:**
1. Indie sales coaches with 5-20 clients
2. Sales bootcamps/courses (Aspireship, Vendition, etc.)
3. SDR agencies (SDRHire, SalesAR, etc.)

#### 5. **Content Marketing (SEO Play)**

**10 Blog Posts for Long-Tail Traffic:**
1. "Best AI sales roleplay tools in 2026"
2. "How to practice cold calling without burning leads"
3. "Sales roleplay scenarios: 15 examples for training"
4. "Objection handling practice: AI vs. traditional roleplay"
5. "How to reduce SDR ramp time with AI training"
6. "Customer service de-escalation training with AI"
7. "The angry customer: how to handle difficult conversations"
8. "SDR training program checklist for startups"
9. "Solo sales rep? How to practice without a partner"
10. "Why sales roleplay doesn't work (and what to do instead)"

## Part 5: Messaging and Positioning

### Core Positioning Statement

**For:** Individual sales reps and small sales teams  
**Who:** Need to practice conversations without burning real prospects  
**Roleplay Studio is:** An AI conversation training platform  
**That:** Lets you practice any sales or support scenario with realistic AI personas  
**Unlike:** Enterprise tools costing $50+/seat or awkward peer roleplays  
**We:** Offer affordable, on-demand practice starting at $29/month

### Key Messages by Persona

#### For Individual Sales Reps ($29/mo):
> "Practice 100 cold calls before your first real one. Our AI won't judge you, but it will push back like real prospects do."

#### For Sales Managers ($99/mo):
> "Your new SDRs need 50+ hours of roleplay before they're ready. You don't have 50 hours. We do."

#### For Support Teams:
> "Train for the angry customer before they're on the phone. Not after."

### Differentiators vs. Competition

| Competitor Positioning | Roleplay Studio Counter |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| "Enterprise-grade AI roleplay" | "Professional training, startup-friendly pricing" |
| "Cold calling specific" | "Sales AND support scenarios in one platform" |
| "Request a demo for pricing" | "Transparent pricing. Start today for $29." |
| "AI scoring and analytics" | "Voice + text modes for natural practice" |

### Headline Options (Test These)

1. **"Your 24/7 Sales Sparring Partner"**
2. **"Practice Selling Without Burning Real Leads"**
3. **"AI That Pushes Back Like Real Prospects"**
4. **"1000 Practice Calls Before Your First Real One"**
5. **"Never Wing a Sales Call Again"**

### Objection Handling for Sales Conversations

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We just do peer roleplay" | "How many reps practice more than once a week? AI is available 24/7, no scheduling needed." |
| "AI can't replicate real conversations" | "Try our angry customer persona. It'll surprise you how realistic the pushback is." |
| "We're too small for this" | "That's exactly who this is built for. Enterprise tools cost $50+/seat. We're $29." |
| "My team won't use it" | "Start with one champion. When they improve, others will ask what they're doing differently." |
| "What about our specific scenarios?" | "Business plan includes custom persona creation. Let's build your exact ICP." |
