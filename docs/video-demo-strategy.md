## Voiceover Script (Hero Demo)

```
[HOOK - 0:00]
"What would you say to an angry customer who's about to cancel?
Or a skeptical CFO who thinks your price is too high?
Most people freeze up. But what if you could practice first?"

[PROBLEM - 0:15]
"Traditional training doesn't work. Reading scripts doesn't prepare you 
for real conversations. And role-playing with coworkers? Awkward."

[SOLUTION - 0:45]
"Roleplay Studio lets you practice with AI personas that talk back.
Watch this..."

[DEMO - Show screen recording]
"I'm talking to Margaret, an angry customer whose account keeps getting locked.
She's frustrated, she's interrupting, she wants answers.
And I have to de-escalate this in real-time."

[Show conversation happening]

"The AI adapts to what I say. If I show empathy, she calms down.
If I give canned responses, she gets angrier."

[RESULTS - 1:30]
"After the call, I get a detailed score.
How was my empathy? Did I take ownership? Did I offer a real solution?
Users who practice with Roleplay Studio see a 40% improvement in their 
real-world performance within two weeks."

[CTA - 2:00]
"25 scenarios. Sales, support, HR, leadership.
