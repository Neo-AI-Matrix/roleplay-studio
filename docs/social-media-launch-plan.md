## Phase 2: ScoreApp Quiz Funnel

### Why ScoreApp?
Daniel Priestley method: Give value first (assessment), capture lead, nurture with results. Quiz takers convert 3-5x better than cold traffic.

### Recommended Quiz: "Sales Readiness Assessment"

Already built in `/roleplay-studio/docs/scorecard-campaigns.md`

**Quick Setup:**

1. **Sign up:** https://scoreapp.com (free trial, then ~$49/mo)
2. **Create scorecard** using our 12 questions from the doc
3. **Set up results pages** with personalized recommendations
4. **Connect email** (we need an ESP first—see below)
5. **Embed on site** or use standalone URL

### Alternative: Typeform + Zapier
If ScoreApp cost is a concern:
- Typeform ($29/mo) for the quiz
- Zapier to send results to email
- Manual scoring logic

### Quiz Funnel Flow
```
Ad/Social Post → Quiz Landing Page → 12 Questions → Results Page → Email Capture → Nurture Sequence → Free Trial CTA
```
